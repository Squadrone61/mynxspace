## Feedback please 
You think i need to do "this" "the other way" instead of "this way"? Or you have other comments?
  
please feel free to send feedback. It's very important to me 游뗵

## Run this yourself

`npm run front:dev` to serve the angular app.

`npm run api:dev` to serve the nestJS app (not necessary).

`npm run start` to do production build & run it
